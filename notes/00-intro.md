# Introduction to rust

Rust is mostly used in systems programming, like C. The difference being that rust is safer, and has a good compiler that refuses to compile with any bugs (not logical ones obviously). 

Some tools used along with rust (when doing systems programming):
* cargo - a dependency manager and build tool
* rustfmt - a formatting tool (similar to eslint or pretty)
